### Research

The Love Lab uses statistical models to infer biologically meaningful
patterns in high-dimensional datasets, and develops
open-source statistical software for the [Bioconductor Project](https://bioconductor.org).
At UNC-Chapel Hill, we often collaborate with groups in the 
*Genetics Department* and the *Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center*, 
studying how genetic variants relevant to diseases are associated with changes
in molecular and cellular phenotypes.

* We collaborate with the [Patro lab](http://www.robpatro.com/) in the
  development of computational and statistical methods for
  quantification of RNA transcript abundance, including the software
  packages [Salmon](https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon/)
  and [tximeta](https://bioconductor.org/packages/tximeta).
* We collaborate with the [Stein lab](https://steinlab.org) in the
  study of genetic risk for neuropsychiatric disorders, leveraging
  data from molecular assays of chromatin accessibility and the
  transcriptome in neural progenitor cell lines to macroscale
  phenotypes such as gross human brain structure measured with MRI.
* We collaborate with the
  [Troester lab](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/melissa-troester-phd/) 
  and the Carolina Breast Cancer Study, investigating the intersection
  between gene expression profiles of breast tumors and genetic risk
  for breast cancer, with a focus on racial disparities in patient
  outcomes.
* We develop, support, and maintain the
  [DESeq2](http://bioconductor.org/packages/DESeq2) package
  for statistical analysis of RNA-seq and other sequencing experiments,
  and associated packages and workflows for analyzing genomics
  data. See the [Software](pages/software.html) tab for more details.

### PI - Background

From 2013-2016, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the group of
Rafael Irizarry in the Biostatistics and Computational Biology
Department at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Harvard
TH Chan School of Public Health.
I completed a PhD in Computational Biology and Scientific Computing
(2013) in the Vingron Department at the Max Planck Institute for
Molecular Genetics in Berlin and the Mathematics and Informatics
Department of the Freie Universit√§t, Berlin.  I completed a Statistics
M.S. (2010) and Mathematics B.S. (2005) at Stanford University.
