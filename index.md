### Research

The Love Lab uses statistical models to infer biologically meaningful
patterns from high-throughput sequencing data, and develops
open-source statistical software for the Bioconductor Project.
A major effort of the lab is maintaining
the [DESeq2 package](http://bioconductor.org/packages/DESeq2) for
statistical analysis of RNA-seq experiments, and associated packages
and workflows for analyzing genomics data.

### PI - Background

From 2013-2016, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the group of
Rafael Irizarry in the Biostatistics and Computational Biology
Department at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Harvard
TH Chan School of Public Health.
I completed a PhD in Computational Biology and Scientific Computing
(2013) in the Vingron Department at the Max Planck Institute for
Molecular Genetics in Berlin and the Mathematics and Informatics
Department of the Freie Universit√§t, Berlin.  I completed a Statistics
M.S. (2010) and Mathematics B.S. (2005) at Stanford University.
