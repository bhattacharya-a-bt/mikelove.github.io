### Research

I use statistical models to infer biologically meaningful
patterns from high-throughput sequencing data, and develop
open-source statistical software for the Bioconductor Project.
One of my major research efforts is in authoring and maintaining the
[DESeq2 package](http://bioconductor.org/packages/DESeq2) for statistical
analysis of RNA-seq experiments.

### Background

From 2013-2016, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the group of
Rafael Irizarry in the Biostatistics and Computational Biology
Department at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Harvard
TH Chan School of Public Health.
I completed a PhD in Computational Biology and Scientific Computing
(2013) in the Vingron Department at the Max Planck Institute for
Molecular Genetics in Berlin and the Mathematics and Informatics
Department of the Freie Universit√§t, Berlin.  I completed a Statistics
M.S. (2010) and Mathematics B.S. (2005) at Stanford University.
